    <h2>How to play</h2>
    <div>Prepare a stack of imperium cards and the intrigue stack from the board game.</div>
    <br />
    <div>
      Add up to four players here, select wether they should be ai-controlled, prepare the starting decks for all players and
      you're ready to go.
    </div>
    <br /><br /><br />
    <h4>AI rules</h4>
    <h5>During Turns</h5>
    <div>
      The ai will tell you which board space it wants to go to, depending on its goals and resources. You will have to use
      their cards to check wether it can actually go to the board space it wants to go to.
    </div>
    <br />
    <h5>Reveal Phase</h5>
    <div>
      When buying cards for the ai, use a simple formula: <br /><i
        >persuasion costs + board space access + persuasion on reveal</i
      >
      <br />
      Always buy the card(s) with the highest value. <br />Then update the "cards bought" value for the ai accordingly.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>When trashing cards for thei ai, always prefer cards from the starting deck.</div>
    <br /><br /><br />
