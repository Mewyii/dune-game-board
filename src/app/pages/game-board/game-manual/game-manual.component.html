    <h2>How to play</h2>
    <div>Prepare the intrigue deck from the board game.</div>
    <br />
    <div>Add up to four players here, select wether they should be AI-controlled and you're ready to go.</div>
    <br /><br /><br />
    <h4>AI rules</h4>
    <h5>During Turns</h5>
    <div>
      The AI will tell you which board space it wants to go to (depending on its goals and resources). You will have to check
      for additional card effects or tech tile effects.
    </div>
    <br /><br /><br />
    <h5>Finale</h5>
    <div>Each <b>controlled location</b> (even by a dreadnought) gives the player one victory point.</div>
    <br /><br /><br />
    <h4>New mechanics / symbols</h4>
    <div>
      <b>Dreadnoughts</b> now have 4 combat strength. They always need to rest one round after they were put into conflict.
      When a conflict is won, each involved dreadnought can be placed on one location of choice to control it. At the next
      reveal turn, the control-reward can be collected and the dreadnought can be removed or it can stay (players choice).
      Enemy dreadnoughts controlling locations can be destroyed in two ways: By placing a dreadnought OR by placing a
      control-marker on top of the locations.
