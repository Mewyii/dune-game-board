    <h4>AI</h4>
    <div>
      The AI will move on its own (depending on its goals and resources) when you click on the hourglass-button below it's
      leader image. You will be noticed about custom effects it is not able to comprehend yet, like leader or tech tile

    </div>
    <h4>New mechanics / symbols</h4>
    <div>
      <b>Endgame</b> is now triggered when a player has 8 (or 9 in a 3-player-game) victory points at the end of a round.
      Then, one final round is played, after which the game ends and endgame effects on cards are triggered.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <b>Tech tiles</b> may now have faction-symbols printed on them. Those are tech tiles that are related to those faction.
      They can be used to activate a connection of a card by flipping them in addition to their printed effects.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <b>Locations</b> now have give the controlling player resources (on the left side) at their reveal turn. They also give
      the controlling player a victory point as long as they control the location (similar to the alliance tokens). If a an
      already occupied location gets taken over by another player, this player has to pay 2 troops from his garrison to take
      it over.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <b>Dreadnoughts</b> now have 4 combat strength. They always need to rest one round after they were put into a conflict.
