    <h2>How to play</h2>
    <div>Add up to four players here, select wether they should be AI-controlled and you're ready to go.</div>
    <br /><br />
    <h4>AI</h4>
    <div>
      The AI will move on its own (depending on its goals and resources). You will be noticed about custom effects it is not
      able to comprehend (yet) and resolve it for them.
    </div>
    <br /><br />
    <h4>New mechanics / symbols</h4>
    <div>
      <b>Locations</b> now have give the controlling player resources (on the left side) at their reveal turn. They also give
      the controlling player a victory point as long as they control the location (similar to the alliance tokens). If a an
      already occupied location gets taken over by another player, this player has to pay a troop from his garrison for it.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <b>Dreadnoughts</b> now have 4 combat strength. They always need to rest one round after they were put into a conflict.
      When a conflict is won, for each involved dreadnought the player can get control of a location of their choice.
