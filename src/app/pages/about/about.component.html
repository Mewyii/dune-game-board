    <h2>About</h2>
    <div>This is a home made web project for the dune imperium game from direwolf digital.</div>
    <br />
    <div>
      It contains a card configurator to create new imperium cards for the game, a leader configurator to create new leaders
      and a fully playable custom game board including ai. The only things that are not digitalized yet are the imperium
      cards, intrigues and tech tiles, which need to be used from the board game.
